* Today **my goal is to live forever.** I decided to start small and move step by step. My plan is as follows:
> Receive the title of Junior Developer upon retirement.
> I also decided to test what the call to lifelong learning looks like in reality.
* It seems to me that this is very important, not only for me, but also for my future teachers, employers and employees.
 
* Of course, I have no experience in development, but before I started a lot of things from scratch and never lost. (Okay, I lied. It happened a couple of times, but the score was in my 
favor). Yes, that's a challenge. But otherwise life is boring, especially forever.
* **Skills:**  HTML, CSS, SASS, LESS, JAVASCRIPT, GIT, NODEJS, REACT. (francly speaking the end of this list is perfectly my aim )  :grinning:
* **Code:** ```<h1>Hello world!</h1>```(to be continue) :grinning:
* **Experience:** (I know that for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have. Sorry. This moment I have nothing :( )
* **Education:** Kyiv State Univercity, physical department.
* **English:** I'll will be able to communicate 2 - 3 month later. 
I have fogotten a lot of... :grinning:
