      <p>  Today my goal is <span class="bold-italic" >to live forever.</span> 
      I decided to start small and move step by step. 
      My plan is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To receive the title of Junior Developer upon retirement</li>
        <li>To make a test what the call to lifelong learning looks like in reality</li>
      </ul>

        It seems to me that this is very important not only for me 
        but also for my future teachers, employers and employees.
 
      <p>Of course I have no experience in development but before 
        I started a lot of things from scratch and never lost. 
        (Okay, I lied. It happened a couple of times, but the score
        was in my favor). 
      </p>
      <p class="bold-italic">  Yes that's a challenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But otherwise life is boring... especially forever.

          I know that for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of 
          experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
          freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity 
          to demonstrate skills they have.
